  "Problem Statement": "â€¢ Rising disease burden in Asia: Stroke, Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) are becoming urgent public-health challenges, surpassing cancer. The economic impact is equally stark: stroke alone consumed US $330 billion in direct health-care outlays in 2019, most of it borne by Asian nations.",
  "Relevant AI Technologies": "â€¢ High failure rates and long development times: Only 6â€“8 % of CNS drug candidates reach the market, and the approval timeline lasts 10-15 years, and the early compound-optimisation (hit-to-lead) stage takes 6â€“9 months.",
  "Expected Outcomes / Success Metrics": "â€¢ High cost to invest a CNS drug: Each approved CNS drug can cost USD 2â€“4 billion, and budgets for IND submissions in the US are USD 5-10 million.",
  "Current Solutions": "If no region-specific R&D solutions are implemented, CNS treatment costs will surpass cancer spending before 2035.",
  "Target Users / Teams Impacted": "Why Now: AI is unlocking a new era of faster, cheaper drug discovery. Breakthroughs from players like Insilico Medicine and Google DeepMind (AlphaFold) have proven that AI can cut years off timelines and reduce costs dramatically. Leveraging this same AI advantage, NeuroLeap-PanAsia Hub focuses on CNS disorders, especially PD and stroke, two diseases that significantly affect the Asia economy.",
  "Data Availability & Readiness": "Predictive Analytics / Forecasting, Generative AI (text, image, video, code generation), Search & Knowledge Retrieval",
  "Integration, Deployment, and Infrastructure Requirements": "By combining in silico, in vitro, and in vivo workflows in cost-efficient, government-supported labs in Southeast Asia, the NeuroLeap-PanAsia Hub aims to deliver CNS drug candidates up to 5Ã— faster and at 1/5th the cost of traditional pipelines.",

Ownership is often unclear, with no standardized follow-up to ensure timely closure. Evidence (photos, timestamps, locations) is inconsistently captured and not reliably linked to cases. Management lacks a consolidated, real-time view across stores, and fragmented data cannot be correlated with sales, food safety audit (SQC) or customer experience. The result is slow resolution, elevated store SQC risk, and the absence of a single, controlled, auditable process to capture, assign, track, and close issues.",

  "Supplier Collaboration Hub": "Collaboration between the company and material suppliers is still largely manual and fragmented across multiple channels (email, WhatsApp, spreadsheets, Microsoft Teams). This fragmentation limits visibility of stock availability and other key parameters (lead time, ROP, etc.), reducing assurance and control for the material team. As a result, there is a higher risk of mismatches between actual stock and agreed quantities, slower response to demand fluctuations, and recurring issues such as supply failures, unreliable material commitments, late deliveries, and heavy manual effort in data compilation.",
